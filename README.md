### About Nodeploy

Nodeploy is the most powerful hosting platform which supports nothing

We created an insane developer experience that free developers from time-consuming jobs, by skipping code previews and unnecessary conversations

### Notice

All of the content is fake, the `nodeploy` cli doesn't actually exist



```json
{
    "title": "Name of the folder",
    "pages": ["first-page", "second-page"]
}
```
