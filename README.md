### About Nodeploy

Nodeploy is the most powerful hosting platform which supports nothing

We created an insane developer experience that free developers from time-consuming jobs, by skipping code previews and unnecessary conversations

### Notice

All of the content is fake, the `nodeploy` cli doesn't actually exist

### Contributions

We're using pnpm

```
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

#### Contribute to our Documentation

We have very few rules on what content you contributed:

1. No porn and racism content
2. No XSS attacks or dangerous content
3. Provide original article url if it is copied from somewhere

All documents is inside the `/content/docs` folder.

To create a new page in docs, you have to edit or create `meta.json` for each folder:

> Assume you have created first-page.mdx

```json
{
    "title": "Name of the folder",
    "pages": ["first-page", "second-page"]
}
```

#### Contribute to our Blog
