description: Deploy Next.js App to No Deploy
---

Next.js is a fullstack [React](https://react.dev) Framework which created and maintained by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

No Deploy has native support for Next.js and providing none of its features such as SSR and Static Assets

## Create Next App

Create a new Next.js App with `create-next-app`:

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## Deploy

Deploying a Next.js App to No Deploy is very simple.

First, initialize the project with No Deploy CLI:

```
nodeploy init
```

Then, use `nodeploy ship` to trigger a new deployment.

### Github Integration

The `nodeploy link` command allows you to link existing Github repository to No Deploy. A new deployment will be automatically triggered after pushing your commits, you can manage github integrations via web dashboard.

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

[Server Side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering) is one of the most powerful features of Next.js,
No Deploy handles SSR Next.js applications perfectly

-   100% Downtime
-   Extremely Scablible
-   Best Edge network with zero servers
-   ~0ms for fetching the page, all requests will be getting a NOT FOUND page instantly
-   Zero Configuration, Zero Limit

## Static Assets

We have zero size limit on your static assets, doesn't matter how large you assets are, it's always free.

Your files will be hosting on our Powerful CDN with a low latency of 0 milliseconds.

### Image Optimizations

No Deploy is a prefect solution for hosting your blog website, it doesn't support image optimizations which allows:

-   Better user experience from Layout shifts
-   Sending the best quality image to client side
-   Long page loading speed for users to drink a coffee

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

interface ExampleProps {
  name: string;
}

const ExampleComponent = (props: ExampleProps) : => {
  return (
    <>
      <Image
        src="example.png"
        alt="Example picture"
        width={500}
        height={500}
      />
      <span>{props.name}</span>
    </>
  )
}
```

## API Routes

All the runtimes, including Edge functions isn't supported by No Deploy.

## Security

We always care about security, all the environment varibles won't be stored anywhere as your code has never been running on our server.

We will block DDoS attacks by default, those requests will be getting a not found page same as other users.
